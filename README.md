# Godot Zelda

This is a recreation of the original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) using the Godot game engine. 

Our intention is to not be 100% accurate, but rather to make a very similar engine that could be used as a base to create a similar game with relative ease.

We want to keep the source easy to understand and modify.
